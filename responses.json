On the surface, she appeared to be a poised and powerful woman who ran the town with an iron fist. But Regina had a dark secret - she was actually the Evil Queen from the Enchanted Forest who had cast a curse to bring everyone to the Land Without Magic.\n\nIn the Enchanted Forest, Regina had been consumed by her hatred for Snow White after Snow had inadvertently revealed a secret that led to Regina's true love being killed. Regina's heart had turned black with vengeance and she stopped at nothing to destroy Snow White's happiness, even going so far as to curse the entire realm.\n\nWhen the curse struck, Regina was the only one who retained her memories of their former life. In Storybrooke, she was the mayor but also lived a lonely existence without anyone to truly love or care for her. Her adopted son Henry was the only bright spot in her life, though she treated him in a very strict and unaffectionate manner.\n\nEverything changed when Henry's birth mother, Emma Swan, arrived in town. Emma was the product of Snow White and Prince Charming's true love, making her the savior who could break the curse. As Emma began to regain memories of the Enchanted Forest, Regina realized her curse was weakening. She tried everything to undermine Emma and keep the curse intact, not wanting to be held accountable for her evil deeds.\n\nOver time, Emma was able to break the curse and the residents of Storybrooke regained their memories of their former lives. Regina was reviled by the townspeople and even her own adoptive son Henry rejected her for a time after learning the truth about her evil actions.

She began to embrace the light and goodness within herself, using her powers for good instead of evil. It was a long and difficult road, but Regina was finally able to find love, happiness and acceptance - things she had been denied for so long.\n\nRegina's story was one of overcoming darkness, learning from past mistakes, and striving to be a better person.
