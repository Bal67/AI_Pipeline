# AI Pipeline with AWS Bedrock & Prefect

This project implements a full-stack AI pipeline that uses **Prefect** for orchestration, **AWS Bedrock (Claude)** for text generation, and **Streamlit** as the UI. The pipeline allows users to submit prompts, trigger Claude 3 model inference, and monitor runs via logs and retry-aware workflows.

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bal67/AI_Pipeline.git
cd AI_Pipeline
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set AWS Credentials

Create a `.env` file (or set system env vars):

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

Also configure the Prefect `AwsCredentials` block if needed.

---

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Submit a prompt, run the pipeline, and view the logs and results directly in the app.

---

## Testing & Coverage

To run tests and generate a coverage report:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report -m > coverage.txt
```

You can also view an HTML version:

```bash
coverage html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

---

## Monitoring

- All flow runs and task-level logs are visible in the **Prefect UI**
- Streamlit sidebar shows:
  - Recent flow runs
  - Logs from the last run
  - Claude model responses
